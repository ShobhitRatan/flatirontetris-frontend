# Flatiron Tetris

Flatiron Tetris is a JavaScript based Tetris game.

_Made by [Shobhit Ratan](https://github.com/ShobhitRatan) and [Kyle Tomanelli](https://github.com/ktomanelli) for their Flatiron School Mod 3 project._

## How It Works

A user can use the arrow keys to move a falling piece any up, down, left, or right. And space bar to rotate a piece to better fit the Tetris landscape.

## Built Using?

Flatiron Tetris was built using Rails on the backend which handles storing and randomly selecting the default coordinates for available pieces, and Vanilla JavaScript on the frontend which handles displaying the backend-provided coordinates on the 2-dimensional array Tetris grid.

## Software Requirements

- Ruby on Rails

## How to Run (frontend)

- Clone this repo as well as the [backend repo](https://github.com/ShobhitRatan/mod3-project), navigate to the project root in your terminal.
- Run `open index.html` for frontend implementation.
- Run `rails s` for backend implementation.
